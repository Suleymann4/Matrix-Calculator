Introduction
The aim of this homework is to practice on the use of vectors, loops and if-else statements. The use of vectors and loops are necessary in this problem.
Description
In this project, you will write a C++ program that will provide operations performed by a matrix calculator. There are four different operations that are provided by the calculator. The first operation is the addition of two matrices. The second operation is the multiplication of two matrices. The third operation is taking the power of a single matrix.
